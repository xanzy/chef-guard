Chef-Guard CHANGELOG
====================

0.7.2 (UNRELEASED)
------------------
- Add support for Foodcritic > v9.x.x
- Update dependencies order to fix issues resulting from [RFC 85](https://github.com/chef/chef/commit/dc96b2f45b8d8a0c6335c879551d8c1e94e9559c)

- Order the files that are changed or missing before returning an error (GH-106)
- Add a `devenvironment` config option; no dependency checks will be done for this environment

- Add a shared `insecureTransport` transport that can be used by all connections, instead of creating seperate ones for each connection
- Fix a bug that could cause a nil pointer exception when the Git diff was too large to include the patch in the commit details
- Replaced the multisyncer package with an updated version hosted outside the Chef-Guard repo
- Fix a bug that could cause a nil pointer exception while handling GitHub and GitLab error responses

- Updated the Travis conf so it uses Go 1.4
- Updated godep dependencies
- Renamed some config parameters needed for adding Gitlab support (changing Github to just Git in parameter names)
- Renamed the `s3key` and `s3secret` parameters to `bookshelfkey` and `bookshelfsecret` to better reflect their purpose
- Changed the `enterprisechef` parameter to a `type` parameter allowing the values `enterprise`, `opensource` and `goiardi`

- Fixed a bug were a change was committed even when the change failed (fixes GH-68)
- Fixed the custom client endpoint so it redirects to the correct path (fixes GH-71)

- Fixed issue #54 by adding a check to verify if a value is actually configured before using it
- Added code to check if the config file contains values for all required fields

- When you try to overwrite a frozen cookbook return a HTTP 409 error instead of a HTTP 412 so Berkshelf doesn't crash on it but just reports it
